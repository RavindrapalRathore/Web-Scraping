In the process of utilizing Scrapy, I systematically extracted pertinent information from a collection of books. This involved the retrieval of data encompassing book names, prices, URLs, and image URLs. The procedural steps in this program were initiated by the initial extraction of all URLs from the listing page. Subsequently, a comprehensive data harvesting process ensued, wherein each book's name, price, URL, and image URL were systematically gleaned and incorporated into the dataset. This systematic and multi-step approach allowed for the thorough compilation of relevant information pertaining to the books under consideration.
