I've created a web scraping application utilizing the BeautifulSoup library in conjunction with the requests module to systematically gather pertinent information from Etsy's listing pages. This custom program is engineered to extract a comprehensive array of data, including Product Title, Price, Original Price, Delivery details, Stock availability, Product URL, Seller Name, as well as valuable Review and Rating statistics. Once the scraping process is complete, the extracted data is meticulously organized and stored in a structured CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file, facilitating easy access and analysis for a wide range of applications.
